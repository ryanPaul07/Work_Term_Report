        <h2>My Work Term</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>Since this was my first coop work term and first job related to my studies, I didn't have many experiences I could relate this work term to. 
          However, from the new knowledge that I have gained and the amazing people I have met, I would say that this was an amazing opportunity for me.

    <div id="info">
        <h2>What I liked about my Work Term</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>Firstly, I liked how accepting and friendly everyone was towards me; being the first coop student in my department made me nervous, however 
          everyone encouraged and helped me adjust to my new role in no time. I also really enjoyed the work environment and the professionalism everyone 
          had which helped me maintain focus on my tasks and duties. Furthermore, I was also encouraged by how helpful and supporting everyone was.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also respected that making mistakes and asking questions was part of the learning process and was encouraged. This helped me become more conscious 
          of my mistakes and accelerated my learning. Finally, I respected that my role at the company wasn't linear, but rather more focused on the new projects 
          that came by each week. This gave purpose to my tasks and encouraged me to improve at my role.

        <h2>What I didn't like about my Work Term</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>With there being an overwhelming amount of positive impacts, this work term has had on me, I don't believe there are many things I disliked about this work term. 
          However, since I was working on major projects, I always had someone looking over all my work and giving me guidelines. This sometimes made it hard for me to have 
          full responsibility/independence over my work and also restricted me from trying different approaches. This resulted in me sometimes not feeling accomplished as I 
          always thought someone was helping me through each step.

    <!-- My overall learning -->
    <hr>
    <div id="info">
        <h2>My overall learning</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>Over the past 4-months, I have gained a lot of technical knowledge through the work I have done and a lot of soft skills through the interactions I have had.
          <br>
          <br> 
          Technically, I have gained a lot of knowledge regarding networking, virtual machines, servers, data synchronization and the SCADA software that Survalent creates. 
          Having no background in IT gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about switches, packets, layered switches, (OSI), DMZ and routers. Having not learned about these 
          topics in university made this both exciting and challenging for me to grasp. I also gained more knowledge about virtual machines through the projects I worked on. 
          Such as learning more about hyper v's and how-to setup window's virtual machines. I got to troubleshoot servers and physically set up new servers. This helped me 
          visualize and gave me a better understanding of how an actual server functions for my personal projects. Another project I worked on was data synchronization which 
          involved using SQL. This built upon my past knowledge of SQL and made me more sufficient with integrating SQL into my projects. Finally, I also learned a lot of the 
          SCADA programs that Survalent is using. This was something completely new to me, but I enjoyed understanding what Survalent as a company was creating. I also managed
          an internal ticketing portal, which allowed me to improve my communication skills and troubleshooting skills. Being in a fast-moving environment made me adapt to 
          situations quickly and provide efficient solutions to problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          In this work term I have also learned some valuable soft skills which can help me in all aspects of life. Being my first job made it hard for me to open up easily 
          to other, but with everyone being so welcoming and nice made me more relaxed. This helped my personal growth and improved my confidence. I also learned the 
          importance of communication and team work through the interactions I had and the tasks I completed.

    <!-- Next work term -->
    <hr>
    <div id="info">
        <h2>Skills for next Work Term</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>Working at Survalent has allowed me to improve my current skills, while also gaining new ones. These skills will help me perform better in my next term as I 
          will be aware and more conscious of my strengths and weaknesses. By gaining new skills in problem solving and IT, I have become more T shaped rather than only 
          specializing in one topic. This will improve my learning as I will be able to understand the whole product better, rather than only knowing a specific sub-unit. This 
          will allow me to have better and more meaningful conversations, which will improve my skills massively.

    <div id="info">
        <h2>My future goals</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>Moving forward some goals I want to set for myself after going through this work term include, becoming more knowledgeable and independent in the tasks I do. 
          I also want to become more reliable as a person and be able to finish tasks in time with my supervisor's satisfaction. Furthermore, I want to improve my communication 
          and interpersonal skills as having these skills are vital for anyone to be successful in any company. I want to continue to improve my technical skills in both software 
          development and other fields such as IT/Networking or Security. This will allow me to enhance my skills as a programmer as I will have other perspectives which I can use 
          to guide me in my decision making.
