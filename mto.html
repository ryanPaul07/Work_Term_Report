          These goals include taking on more leadership roles to challenge myself, understanding and updating legacy code, familiarizing myself 
          with the company beliefs and values, improving my interpersonal skills and finally improve my technical skills in mainframe development.

        <h2>What I liked about my Work Term</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>I enjoyed working at MTO as I contributed to meaningful projects and got the chance to work with some amazing people. My role as a mainframe developer 
          allowed me to learn some new technologies and helped me understand the importance of such technologies. Furthermore, I valued the experience and knowledge 
          everyone has, it gave me a new perspective and approach to solving unique problems. Finally, I really appreciated the team meetings I attended. It gave me a 
          chance to understand and be a part of meaningful conversations about the project, it helped me understand my role and everyone else's role in relation with the 
          project and overall educated me more about communication within the team and the importance it has in the development of a project.

        <h2>What I didn't like about my Work Term</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>There are many aspects of the work-term which I enjoyed and found myself investing a lot of time in. However, one aspect which I didn't find very appealing was 
          the PL/I and JCL program itself. Coming from using very high-level languages, this was a change for me. I appreciated the work I did and the tasks I completed, however 
          I found that I was more satisfied by visual changes found in front-end languages.  Although I understood the importance of having these languages and the benefits they 
          provide, I still didn't find myself wanting to program in these languages outside of work.

    <div id="info">
        <h2>My overall learning</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>Coming into a different work environment and learning something completely new can be challenging but having very talented people who helped me throughout my 
          tasks made the overwhelming responsibilities as a developer easier.
          <br>
          <br> 
            As a mainframe developer at MTO I had to familiarize myself with PL/I and JCL, which are both used in the development and processing of mainframe programs. 
            PL/I is used to write code for programs and JCL is used as a process manager, which passes PL/I modules to the operating system. Both these languages had their 
            own specific syntax and had a learning curve. After spending a few weeks learning both PL/I and JCL I was able to create basic programs and started to work on 
            updating some legacy code. Maintaining legacy code helped me understand PL/I and JCL faster and allowed me to develop my code faster.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also got the chance to contribute to a large project and develop my own code. This introduced me to working in large teams and handling project requirements. 
            Working in teams allowed me to improve my interpersonal skills, writing/time management skills and debugging skills.  Adding specific comments and following a 
            coding standard made my code more manageable and easier to understand/debug for others. Communicating my needs and questions clarified requirements and made tasks 
            easier. Also integrating my code with other code modules made me write modular and cleaner code.
            <br>
            <br>  
            Finally, all my work and tasks came down to the discussion I had in meetings. These meetings had the biggest impact on me as I got to experience how project 
            requirements are approved, managed and distributed within the teams. I also got the chance to see the business departments perspective on certain design decisions 
            and what requirements they needed. Going to these meetings gave me an idea of the bigger picture and helped me analyze the project in a broader sense. This made 
            me realise why certain requirements are necessary and need to be implemented.

          in the future. Having learned about the mainframe, I now have the foundation to build and debug my own programs. Also, I have more experience working in a development 
          team and find myself being more comfortable with team members with different coding techniques.
